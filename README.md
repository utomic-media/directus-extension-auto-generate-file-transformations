## ⚙ Settings
Select one or more of the system-transformation-preset. You can also add your custom transformations based on their key.</br>For transformations using 'auto' format (e.g system-transformations)), AVIF versions are generated by this extension (matching Directus' primary format preference for browser-supported formats).

## ⚙️ Installation
To install the extension, take a look at the [Official Guide](https://docs.directus.io/extensions/installing-extensions.html).
After installation it will register the required settings-field on the next server-startup.

### Installation via npm

```
npm i directus-extension-auto-generate-file-transformations
```

or

```
pnpm i directus-extension-auto-generate-file-transformations
```


### Installation via marketplace
By default the marketplace won't show this extension as it's not sandboxed.
Unfortunately the current state of sandboxed-extensions is too limited and wouldn't allow this extension to create and read the settings-fields.

However, you can force Directus Marketplace to show all extensions via the MARKETPLACE_TRUST environment variable:
```env
MARKETPLACE_TRUST=all
````

Afterwards this extension can easily be installed through the in-build directus marketplace. Just go to settings -> marketplace and search for auto-generate-file-transformations.
